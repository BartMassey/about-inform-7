Book - Out Of World

Helping is an action out of world. Carry out helping: say "For this help, say 'help'. For basic information, say 'version'. For acknowledgments, say 'acks'. For other help, I'm afraid you're out of luck." Understand "help" as helping.

Acknowledging is an action out of world. Carry out acknowledging: say "Sources for this work include the Inform 7 documentation, [italic type]Inform 7 for Programmers,[roman type] the [italic type]Inform 7 Handbook,[roman type] Aaron Reed's book [italic type]Creating Interactive Fiction with Inform 7[roman type] and a whole bunch of other stuff scattered around the web.[paragraph break]My brother, Byron Massey (20 September 1967 â€“ 11 October 2010), was the great player of games in our family, and I wish I could show him what I'm doing. I think he might think it was cool." Understand "acknowledgements" or "acknowledgments" or "acks" as acknowledging.

When play begins, say "Copyright (c) 2012 Bart Massey[paragraph break]This text 'adventure' is both the 'slides' for my talk and a couple of demo apps. One demo app, a Nim player, is based on a graphical Nim player I wrote for the 128K Macintosh around 1982. It plays perfectly, but only plays as second player, so it is beatable. The other demo app is a more traditional text adventure puzzle.[paragraph break]The briefing itself uses a not-yet-complete 'books' extension I'm working on that provides fairly elaborate book behavior. To see the talk slides, say 'read book' and keep saying it until you're done. Say 'help' for further meta-information."

The maximum score is 2.

Book - The Briefing Room

There is a room called The Briefing Room. "This wood-paneled study is adequately if indirectly lit by wall-mounted lamps along the walls. In the center of the room is a table, and on the table are several books. Open doorframes lead west and south. A restroom door lies to the east."

The briefing table is fixed in place scenery in The Briefing Room. "This sturdy polished table of light mahogany has plenty of space to spread out."

A bookmark is a kind of thing. A bookmark has a number called the bookmarked page.

[XXX: By default, it's nice to be able to see the bookmark hanging out of a book. Of course, if you allow putting other things in books you may want to do something more sophisticated. Or you may just want to force people to open books to see the bookmarks...]

"Inform 7 is a language for writing text adventures.[p]I7 builds on Inform 6, a standard-looking (mostly) procedural language.[p]I6 is built on the Infocom [italic type]z-code[roman type] infrastructure.[p]I7 compiles to I6, which compiles to z-code.[p]Anything with a keyboard and display probably runs z-code."
"The goal of I7 is to allow game authors to write in lightly-stylized English.[p]It turns out to be doable (even nice?) to write fairly intricate behaviors in this style.[p]Specifying machines, non-player characters (NPCs), complex environments, time, scenes, data structures, reasonable user I/O, and the like in I7 is routine for game writers.[p]In support of this, I7 offers powerful first-class features including a relation-base, constraint solvers, full functional programming, etc---all in reasonablish English."
"The behavior of the book you are reading now was specified in maybe 30 paragraphs of I7.[p]The behavior and environment of the NPC next door, which includes playing perfect Nim, was specified in about 10 paragraphs.[p]Rather than give examples here, I would suggest that you go out-of-world (a cool power) and look at the I7 source to the tinyverse you live in."
"Learning I7 takes a while and is challenging.[p]The community is great, and mostly lives on a MUD.[p]The IDE is pretty nice. Sadly, it works best on Windows, then Mac, then X, but even on X it is quite usable.[p]There's a ton of documentation, but it is quite scattered; I need to work on a metapage.[p]The manual isn't my style: sort of random examples that wind in a not-too-structured way through this vast language."
"There are several downsides to I7.[p]The not-quite-English can be hard to remember and write (although the tools really try to help).[p]The language is huge and changes fairly regularly.[p]The open source situation is...complicated.[p]The limitations of zcode show through.[p]The learning curve is longggg."
"People write non-game-ish demos and stuff in I7 all the time. This is just one example. You can find more on the web.[p]I7 is also a good model for how to do user interaction via DSL. I think it generalizes to GUI UX etc.[p]Inform 7 is cool. You should learn it."



Volume - Nimrod

To decide what number is the xor of (a - a number) and (b - a number):
	(- ({a} + {b} - 2 * ({a} & {b})) -).

Who can say?" instead; if n < 1, say "Clever...but also illegal. Nimrod glares mercilessly at you as you pull your hand back." instead. 

Carry out taking a number (called n) stones from a pit (called p): now the stone count of p is the stone count of p - n; say "You feel [n stones] magically fade away at your touch. [The p] now contains [the stone count of p stones]."; try Nimrod moving.

The Airlock is a room. It is below the upper hatch and above the lower hatch. "You hang from a metal ladder in a circular metal shaft. The room is bathed in the reddish light of emergency lamps. There are vents in the wall of the shaft near the top and the bottom. A lower hatch,  [lower hatch position] below you, leads to the Demo Room; an upper hatch, [upper hatch position] above, leads...who knows?" Some reddish lamps are scenery in the Airlock. The description is "These incandescent lamps, obscured by metal gratings, emit an orange-red glow."  Understand "lights", "light" and "lamp" as the lamps.  Some vents are scenery in the Airlock. The description is "The vents are covered with dinged and pitted metal grating. Behind them is an ominous darkness." Understand "vent" as the vents. The xyzzy-room of the Airlock is the Demo Room.

A hatchway is a kind of door which is openable and lockable. It is usually closed. It is scenery. To say (H - a hatchway) position: if H is open, say "open"; otherwise say "closed".

The upper hatch is a locked hatchway. It is above the Airlock. The description is "This [upper hatch position] hatch leads from the Airlock into the mysterious unknown."

The lower hatch is an unlocked hatchway. It is below the Airlock and above the Demo Room. The description is "This [lower hatch position] hatch connects the Airlock and the Demo Room."

Section 3 - The Hatch Wheel System

The hatch wheel is in the Airlock. "A small metal wheel protrudes from a shaft halfway up the wall opposite you." It is fixed in place. The wheel can be either pointing upward or pointing downward. It is pointing downward. The description is "This is a rough metal wheel with four spokes affixed to the wall. It looks like some kind of control. There is a red mark painted on the wheel, currently at [mark placement]."  To say mark placement: if the wheel is pointing upward, say "the top of the wheel"; otherwise say "the bottom of the wheel".

To decide whether the wheel is active: if the lower hatch is closed and the upper hatch is closed and the slot is loaded, decide yes; otherwise decide no. To decide whether the wheel is inactive: if the wheel is active, decide no; otherwise decide yes. Before turning the wheel, ignore the can't turn what's fixed in place rule. Instead of turning the wheel when the wheel is inactive: say "The wheel wiggles, but refuses to move.". After turning the wheel, say "The wheel turns creakily through a half revolution. Dry, sterile-smelling air pours from the upper vents and flows out the lower vents for a moment, then stops. Eerie quiet resumes." Carry out turning the wheel when the wheel is active and the wheel is pointing downward: now the lower hatch is locked; now the upper hatch is unlocked; now the wheel is pointing upward; rule succeeds. Carry out turning the wheel when the wheel is active and the wheel is pointing upward: now the lower hatch is unlocked; now the upper hatch is locked; now the wheel is pointing downward; rule succeeds.

The slot is in the Airlock. "Next to the wheel is a small slot." The description is "The slot is entirely nondescript. It is vertical: about the height and width of a silver dollar." It is fixed in place. The slot can be either loaded or unloaded. It is unloaded. Loading it into is an action applying to two touchable objects. Carry out loading the zorkmid into the slot: say "The zorkmid vanishes into the slot with a metallic clink."; remove the zorkmid from play; now the slot is loaded; rule succeeds. Carry out loading an object into the slot: say "You look more closely at the [noun] and at the slot and change your mind." Understand "put [thing] in/into [slot]" as loading it into. Understand "drop [thing] in/into [slot]",  "insert [thing] in/into [slot]" and "load [thing] in/into [slot]" as loading it into.
