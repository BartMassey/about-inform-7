He notes that 'An ontology specifies a vocabulary with which to make assertions, which may be inputs or outputs of knowledge agents (such as a software program).  As an interface specification, the ontology provides a language for communicating with the agent.  An agent supporting this interface is not required to use the terms of the ontology as an internal encoding of its knowledge. Nonetheless, the definitions and formal constraints of the ontology do put restrictions on what can be meaningfully stated in this language.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">This is the lecture about upper ontology rule: lecture saying &quot;<span class="quote">An upper ontology is generic rules used to build other ontologies. Inform 7 is either an upper ontology or an ontology for writing text adventures; it's kind of hard to tell.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">One can easily imagine reimplementing or extending Inform 7 to work (well) outside the domain of text adventures.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">This is the lecture about relations-actions rule: lecture saying &quot;<span class="quote">Early ontologies described systems like naïve physics in which action (system change) plays an important role. The recent trend is in the other direction: describing passive systems in terms of simple, often binary relations.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">OWL/RDF and Protege are capable description languages, but they do not have any particular support for active systems. One can specify relations that imply actions (reification), but it's all kind of awkward and inexpressive.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">Mark Heller says 'modeling time, or action, as would be found in describing the interrelationships between objects was difficult. For example, how a mob interacts with a room by walking or jumping up and down was something that felt unintuitive in the inheritance hierarchy.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">This is the lecture about declarative rule: lecture saying &quot;<span class="quote">There's a fine line between a semantic description of action and a computer program (c.f. Nimrod). It is interesting to consider in what sense Inform 7 is declarative.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">Arguably, Inform 7 is as declarative as Cyc's CycL. I7 is a much more expressive language than CycL. However, its encoding of procedural knowledge raises some important questions about the ontology enterprise.</span>&quot;</p>
