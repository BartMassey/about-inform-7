These were originally the notes from my 7 March 2012
[Zissou Society for Programming Language Exploration](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/pdxlang)
talk on [Inform 7](http://inform7.com).

They have now also been used for my 30 April 2012 Portland
State University Systems Science seminar talk on Inform 7.
