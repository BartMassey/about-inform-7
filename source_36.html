Board state descriptions are user scribbling, blank slate, and outlined. The whiteboard has a board state description called the current board state. The current board state is usually blank slate. After erasing the whiteboard, now the current board state is blank slate.

A marker cap is a kind of thing. The description of a marker cap is usually &quot;<span class="quote">This cap keeps the marker from drying up.</span>&quot; A marker cap is part of every marker. Does the player mean doing something with the marker cap: it is unlikely. Instead of doing something other than examining with the marker cap: say &quot;<span class="quote">There is no need to fiddle with the marker cap.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The black marker is a marker on the metal tray. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">This is as generic a whiteboard marker as you'll ever hope to find. It has a black cap.</span>&quot;  </p><p class="indent0">Report writing it on (this is the detailed report writing rule): say &quot;<span class="quote">You take the cap off the marker, write on [</span><span class="substitution">the second noun</span><span class="quote">], and replace the cap carefully.</span>&quot; The detailed report writing rule is listed instead of the report writing rule in the report writing it on rulebook.</p><p class="indent0">An eraser is an erasing tool. The description is usually &quot;<span class="quote">A classic fuzzy whiteboard eraser, none too clean.</span>&quot; On the metal tray is an eraser.</p><p class="indent0">Test whiteboard with &quot;<span class="quote">read whiteboard / erase whiteboard / x whiteboard</span>&quot;.</p>
